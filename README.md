# SimplePhotoApp

"Create a simple album list, photo list and photo detail application, using data from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"


The App is capable of just that: Look at some beautiful squares and read some interesting lorem ipsum stories.
You can also change the zoom factor when you are inside an album. Look at one spuare at a time or up to four in every row. 
You can use the UIStepper to change the scale or use your pinching finger.

Select an image to get to the full story of the shown square.
